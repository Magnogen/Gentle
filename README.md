## A Programming Language for drawing Generative Art

This is the source code for a project I've been working on as a back burner, until now.
It's a programming language designed to paint pieces of generative art.
It treats art as a datatype, like numbers or strings, but you can't really see the art in the code - that is until you run it.

### Why is it called Gentle?

Because... uhhh... GENerative... uhhh... tleart?

Idk it was a good idea at the time, plus it's short and memorable

### Plans for the future
- [ ] An actual working IDE / editor
  - [x] Editable text
  - [ ] Syntax highlighting
  - [ ] Outputs and inputs to the program
  - [ ] Customisation
- [ ] A way to execute the code properly, with actual tokens and such
  - [x] Scanning to tokens
  - [ ] Parsing the tokens into a tree
    - [ ] Expressions
    - [ ] Statements
  - [ ] Evaluating the tree
    - [ ] Gentle programs
    - [ ] JS plugin stuff
- [ ] Simple ways to make your own plugin, like Noise or SDF
  
  Maybe make those plugins with that system?
- [ ] Proper documentation
  - [ ] For using the language
  - [ ] For modding the language with a plugin
